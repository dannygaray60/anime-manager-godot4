# anime-manager-godot4
Anime Manager app made with Godot 4

For personal use to create a basic anime list and keep track of which episode you are watching.

The app will scan the url link of the anime page you want to add. And it will automatically show if there are new episodes to watch.

The application will redirect to the page to watch using the default web browser or the “Web Video Caster” application (activate in options).

At the moment it only supports “animeflv.net” links.
